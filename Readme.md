About Project
The project is a to do project that includes features such as adding a movie, actor, user, watch list, movie scoring, etc. by taking the imdb site as an example. I am developing the project to learn different technologies.


Different technologies will be added to the project and I continue to develop it.
Example: Spring Security and then I will change the project from monolithic structure to micro service architecture.
